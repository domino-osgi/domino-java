= Domino Java - A Java DSL to master OSGi dynamics

This project is in an experimental state.
It tries to bring the comfort of the proven Domino Scala DSL into the Java world.
It make most sense with Java 8 an it's closures, but on demand, I can try to publish a Java7 (and older) compatible variant.
